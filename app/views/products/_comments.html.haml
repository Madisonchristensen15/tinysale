-#        %p It's a winner. They're fantastic email templates with the added benefit of knowing the backstory behind them, to make sure it's the right fit.
-#        %p Now, if you're new around here, they've got Noah's flavor of copy (which I love) and set the right tone, respect and courtesy when needed (such as dealing with customers). Back to my point - if you're new around here, and say, work in a stuffy bank, don't expect to get a "Dear Sir/Madam, Per the correspondence bigword fancyword blah blah..." style templates. They're boring anyway.
-#        %p I give this 5 tacos, but I would give it 10 tacos if there was some Chrome Extension that let me choose a template straight out of GMail (a big, crazy ask I know). That would just crush it. However I should point out, there is a fancy link you click to use the mail template in your default email client - just gotta go through AppSumo first, which is cool.
-#        %p Thanks Natasha!
